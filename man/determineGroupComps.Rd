\title{Creates strings of sample pair comparisons}
\usage{
determineGroupComps(samples1, samples2 = NULL, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples1}{A vector of sample names from one group}

\item{samples2}{A vector of sample names from the other group, if we want to
specify between-group comparisons}

\item{type}{'within' or 'between'. 'within' returns all the sample pairs 
within samples1, 'between' returns all the sample pairs
between samples1 and samples2}
}
\value{
A vector of sample pair comparisons of the form 'sample1 vs sample2'
 for use with the M3D functions
}
\description{
Takes in a vector of strings of sample names and returns strings of 
all the comparisons, either within a testing group or between testing groups.
 This is not intended to be called directly by the user.

\examples{
data(rrbsDemo)
samples1 <- rownames(colData(rrbsDemo))[colData(rrbsDemo)[,]=='H1=hESC']
within1 <- determineGroupComps(samples1,type='within')
