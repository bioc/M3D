\title{Computes p-values}
\usage{
pvals(rrbs, CpGs, MMD, group1, group2, smaller = FALSE,
  comparison = "allReps", method = "empirical", closePara = 0.005)
}
\arguments{
\item{rrbs}{An rrbs object containing methylation and coverage data as
created using the BiSeq pacakge}

\item{CpGs}{A GRanges object with each row being a testing region}

\item{MMD}{A matrix containing the M3D test-statistic, the difference the
 full and methylation blind metrics,
for each region in the CpGs object. Each column is a comparison between two
 samples, which are described in the column names.}

\item{group1}{The name of the first group for the comparison. This is stored
in colData(rrbs)}

\item{group2}{The name of the second group for the comparison. This is stored
in colData(rrbs)}

\item{smaller}{Determines whether the p-value is computed whether the
 test-statistic is greater or lesser than inter-replicate
values. For our purposes, it should be set to FALSE.}

\item{comparison}{Details which groups we are using to define our empirical
 testing distribution. The default is to
use all of them, however, should the user find one group contains unusually
 high variability, then that group can be selected.
Values are either 'allReps', 'Group1' or 'Group2'.}

\item{method}{Determines which method is used to calculate p-values.
'empirical' uses the empirical distribution directly, without modelling.
 This is the default. 'model', fits an exponential distribution to the tail
 of our null distribution.}

\item{closePara}{Sets a threshold for how close the exponential curve should
fit the empirical distribution in the 'model' method. If the method produces
errors, consider raising this parameter.}
}
\value{
Returns a list P, with 2 entries. 'FDRmean' is the Benjamini-Hochberg
 adjusted p-values. The unadjusted p-values are stored in 'Pmean'.
}
\description{
Returns p-values for each region reflecting the probability of observing the
 mean test-statistic
of the between group comparisons among the inter-replicate comparisons.
