Title: Identifies differentially methylated regions across testing groups.

Description: This package identifies statistically significantly differentially
    methylated regions of CpGs. It uses kernel methods (the Maxmimum Mean
    Discrepancy) to measure differences in methylation profiles, and relates
    these to inter-replicate changes, whilst accounting for variation in
    coverage profiles.
