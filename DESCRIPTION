Description: This package identifies statistically significantly
        differentially methylated regions of CpGs. It uses kernel
        methods (the Maximum Mean Discrepancy) to measure differences
        in methylation profiles, and relates these to inter-replicate
        changes, whilst accounting for variation in coverage profiles.
